## Changelog

- Fix: canonicalize output directory path for `CARGO_NDK_OUTPUT_PATH`, fixes build scripts not at workspace root 
- Enhancement: output directory creation error now prints error message instead of panicking

### v3.5.6 - 2024-05-20

- Fix: a type was optional, then wasn't, and now is optional again.

### v3.5.5 - 2024-05-15

- Fix: use correct path on Linux
- Fix: only copy libraries being built

### v3.5.4 - 2024-04-13

- Fix: add compile error if attempted to build for unsupported target OSes (please stop trying to build cargo-ndk *for* Android. Makes no sense.)
- Fix: remove underscore prefixed env vars from `ndk-env`

### v3.5.3 - 2024-04-12

- Enhancement: add usage instructions to the ndk-env output
- Enhancement: add `--powershell` flag to ndk-env

### v3.5.2 - 2024-04-11

- Fix: make `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER` correct

### v3.5.1 - 2024-04-11

- Fix: make the exports from `ndk-env` use underscores

### v3.5.0 - 2024-04-10

- Enhancement: added `ndk-env` command for printing env vars for use with things like rust-analyzer.


Please note the MSRV for _building_ `cargo-ndk` is now 1.73 due to dependency churn.

### v3.4.0 - 2023-09-23

- Enhancement: add additional environment variables for sysroot directories (see README.md)

### v3.3.0 - 2023-08-20

- Enhancement: console output now uses `cargo`'s formatter (and looks prettier)
- Enhancement: panics will print a dump for simplifying bug reports

`RUST_LOG` is therefore now ignored. Use `cargo`'s usual `-v` and `-vv` for verbosity control.

### v3.2.2 - 2023-08-14

- Fix: pass CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and related variables as per `cc` crate behaviour

### v3.2.1 - 2023-07-31

- Fix: pass CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS to cargo correctly (thanks @rib)

### v3.2.0 - 2023-05-24

- Fix: linker workaround made more robust and fixing too many args issues (thanks @rib)

### v3.1.2 - 2023-05-12

- Enhancement: use `OUT_DIR` to hold the `cargo-ndk` wrapper executables on Windows (thanks @ScSofts)

### v3.1.1 - 2023-05-10

- Fix: use `raw_args` for the Windows workaround subprocesses because random quotation marks still leak in

### v3.1.0 - 2023-05-09

- Workaround: NDK r25 on Windows does not work with Rust (https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk/issues/92, https://github.com/android/ndk/issues/1856). `cargo-ndk` works around this by filtering the arguments before being passed to the NDK build scripts.

I wish everyone a very good day, except Google.

### v3.0.1 - 2023-03-24

- Fix: specifying `--profile dev` will now look in the `debug` target directory as expected.

### v3.0.0 - 2023-03-11

`libgcc` will no longer be linked against resultant libraries, and the workaround code in `cargo-ndk` has been removed.

See https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/01/09/android-ndk-update-r25.html for more information.

- **Breaking change**: minimum supported version of Rust is now 1.68.
